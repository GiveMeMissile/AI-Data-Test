This test is simply using a CNN trained on the bad Dataset to see if a CNN can learn the contents of the Bad Dataset.
I created the CNN so that you can change the number of layers and hidden units with user input without any errors.
I plan to use this same model for different tests.
Also the model names contain info on the layers and hidden units the model was trained in.
For example the saved model t2_hl2_hf64_model_001.pth. t2 stands for test 2, hl2 stands for 2 hidden layers, hf stands for 64 hidden features.
This model is used for easy testing of data with the customizabiliy with the changeable hidden layers and features.
